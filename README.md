Governance
==========

The official governance documents for the RIT Linux Users Group. All
work is open-source and suggestions to improve these documents is
welcome.

All changes to the constitution are required to be submitted to the clubs
office for approval, so actual acceptance of changes may lag a bit. When
new versions of these policies are accepted, they should be printed and
the hard copies in the club binder should be updated.

Requirements
-----------
* texlive-core
* texlive-latexextra

(these are likely available in your package manager, but may be under
different names). You may wish to install additional packages if you
prefer to edit LaTeX in a specialized editor.


Compiling
-----------
These documents are maintained in LaTeX and must be compiled. LaTeX supports
compiling to a variety of formats. In RITlug, we most often need these
documents in PDF format.

Once you have the requirements installed, you can build the policies by
running

`make`

You should then have a governance.zip file, which will contain the PDFs for
the policies.
